# ViBE Server

ViBE's server is a SmokeSignal V6 server, that manages the economy of my model nation, the UMS. It includes the following SmokeSignal Extensions:
<br>
- The default dummy extension (V1.0)
- ViBE Server Super Extension (V1.0)
  - I will admit, this is a bit of a bodge. It moves all the command parsing that used to be handled on the main class in V5 to an extension. However, it works.
- LBL File Transfer (V2.0)
- IncomeMan Express (V2.1)
<br>
The ViBE server runs on port 757, and makes some modifications to the main SmokeSignal Class. It's ok. SmokeSignal started off as ViBE's servers, so I find these modifications legal.
